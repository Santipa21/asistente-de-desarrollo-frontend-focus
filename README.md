# Frontend Dev Assistant

Frontend Dev Assistant is a React-based web application designed to help frontend developers with various tasks, including code analysis, task planning, problem-solving, and executing commands via a simulated terminal interface. It's built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   **Code Assistant**: Analyze React/TypeScript code, get suggestions for improvements, access useful code snippets, and review best practices.
*   **Task Planner**: Generate task plans for frontend projects based on ideas, view templates for project organization (folder structure, commit conventions), and copy GitHub issue templates.
*   **Problem Solver**: Describe frontend issues to get diagnostic help, browse common frontend problems and their solutions (quick, stable, optimal), and see a list of debugging tools.
*   **Command Interface**: Interact with a simulated terminal to execute helper commands for planning, explaining concepts, suggesting improvements, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend-dev-assistant
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Available Scripts

*   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
*   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
*   `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
*   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for preview.

## Technologies Used

*   Vite
*   React
*   TypeScript
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Lucide React (for icons)
*   ESLint

## Important Note on Simulated Functionality

Please be aware that the core intelligent features of this Frontend Dev Assistant application are currently **simulated**. This includes:

*   **Code Analysis** in the "Code Assistant" section.
*   **Task Generation** in the "Task Planner" section.
*   **Problem Diagnosis and Solution Generation** in the "Problem Solver" section.
*   **Command Processing** in the "Command Interface" section.

The application demonstrates the UI and UX flow for these features, but the underlying logic uses `setTimeout` to mimic processing delays and returns pre-defined, static responses.

For this application to be used in a real-world scenario, these simulated functionalities would need to be replaced with:

*   Actual algorithms for code analysis, task planning, etc.
*   Integration with backend services or APIs (e.g., AI models, linters, project management tools).
*   Database integration for storing user data or preferences if needed.

This project serves as a good starting point or UI prototype for such a tool.
